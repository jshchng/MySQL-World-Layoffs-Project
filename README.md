# MySQL Data Cleaning Project - World Layoffs

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to clean and prepare a dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) related to recent layoffs in the tech industry.

### Background

Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks, and strong dollars overseas are hinting toward a possible recession, and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees. This dataset was made with the hope of enabling the Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights.

## Data Cleaning Process
**Step 1: Import and Clean Data**

- 1. Remove Duplicates: Identify and eliminate any duplicate records.
- 2. Standardize Data: Correct inconsistencies and standardize data formats.
- 3. Handle Null Values: Address missing values, either by filling them in or determining if they should be retained.
- 4. Prune Unnecessary Data: Remove any irrelevant columns or rows.



## Data Exploration
**Step 2: Analyze Data to Uncover Patterns** 
- Identify the timing of layoffs: When did they occur?
- Determine the industry with the highest number of layoffs.
- Investigate if there is a particular pattern or trend in the timing of layoffs.
- Find out which industry experienced the fewest layoffs.
- Analyze how layoffs vary by country.
- Explore whether funding levels influence the frequency of layoffs.
